##Automating Build and Download to our P2 development boards

This Document is being developed over time as I prove a working environment for each of my target platforms.  I'm expecting to document building on Windows, MacOS, and RaspberryPiOS.

I'm also expecting to document building and download with various tools such as Flexspin, download with direct attached boards via USB, download via Wifi with the Wx boards attached to our development board, with more compilers as they come ready for multi-platform use, etc.

## Tasks in VScode

A Task is how we automate behaviors in VScode.

There are a number of types of tasks and places Task definitions live. These include Users Tasks, Built-in Tasks, and Project-specific Tasks.

...More TBA...

### Invoking tasks

A project can have a single default build task invoke with comamnd-shift-B. We'll testing having our download tasks activiated with specific key-strokes as well.

We'll also test using the file-watch technoology to automatically compile and download our project files when they are modified.

## Building with Flexspin on macOS

Here is a project-specific file for macOS: **.vscode/tasks.json**

```json
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "compile",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "/Applications/Flexprop/bin/flexspin.mac",
            "args": [
                "-2",
                "${fileBasename}"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": {
                "owner": "Spin2",
                "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceFolder}"],
                "pattern": {
                "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):\\s+(warning|error):\\s+(.*)$",
                "file": 1,
                "line": 2,
                "severity": 3,
                "message": 4
                }
            },
            "presentation": {
                "panel": "new"
            },
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        },
        {
            "label": "download",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "/Applications/Flexprop/bin/loadp2.mac",
            "problemMatcher": [],
            "args": [
                "-b230400",
                "${fileBasenameNoExtension}.binary",
                "-t"
            ],
            "dependsOn": [
                "compile"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This provides the comamds to be run for compile and download. Download will always be preceeded by a compile.

TODO: ensure download doesn't proceed if compile fails
