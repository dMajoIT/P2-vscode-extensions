Unit-testing our Tabbing:
	
	TAB Cases:
		[TIP1] insert point in non-white
		- PASS, no adverse visuals
		
		[TIP2] insert point in white
		- PASS w/CURSOR BUG, should move with spaces added
		- POSS-FIX: change insert to be cursor-1?
		
		[Group TSE1-4] --- 1st char (left-most) of selection is whitespace ---
			[TSE1] Selection is all white (and DOES span a tab-stop)
			- PASS w/CURSOR BUG, should move to left edge of text
			- no poss fix until we can place cursor
			
			[TSE2] Selection starts in white, ends in non-white (and whitespace DOES span a tab-stop)
			
			[TSE3] Selection is all white (and does NOT span a tab-stop)
			
			[TSE4] Selection starts in white, ends in non-white (and whitespace does NOT span a tab-stop)
			
		[Group TSE5,6] --- 1st char of selection is NOT whitespace ---
