[![License][license-shield]](LICENSE)

VSCode support for the Propeller languages: Spin2 and Pasm2 for the [Parallax Inc.](https://parallax.com) Propeller 2 [P2 or P2X8C4M64P](https://propeller.parallax.com/p2.html). The P2 community thrives in the [P2 Forums](https://forums.parallax.com/categories/propeller-2-multicore-microcontroller)

## Features
- Syntax Highlighting for both Spin2 and Pasm2 including all Streamer and Smart Pin Symbols
- File Navigation
- Works with your favorite VSCode themes
- Offers companion Themes (orginal and my development theme)

### Up next
- Build and download support (using external compiler and download tool) - *Still figuring this out*


*These are all arriving over time and not yet fully functional.*

---

This repository contains two subprojects. Each of which are vscode extensions:

- SPIN2 and PASM2 syntax Highlighting and code navigation [spin2](./spin2) - *Builds*
- SPIN1 and PASM1 syntax highlighting [spin1](./spin1) - *DOES NOT BUILD*

*Each of these two are self contained and package their own extension but spin1 will be migrated into spin2 shortly*
